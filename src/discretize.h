 * This function discretizes the mesh attached to a geometry.

 * Parameters:
 *    mesh:             a vector of three vectors, each containing the
 * coordinates of the divisions in one direction of the actual mesh.
 *    vol_handles:      a map of the EntityHandles of the various volumes of the
 * geometry.
 *    num_rays:         The number of rays to be fired.
 *    grid:             Whether the rays are to be fired evenly spaced apart or
 * at random. True if evenly spaced.
 *
 * Returns:
 *    A vector of the results for each row, consisting of the sum of the values
